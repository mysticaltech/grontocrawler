# TODOs for Grontocrawler

Grontocrawler is an OWL ontology to directed graph transformation tool. It uses
a rule-based approach to produce arcs among the concepts, each arc is justified
by a set of OWL axioms. Below we maintain a list of things to be done.

* [ ] propagation of is-a arcs
* [ ] add concept annotations to distinguish from biological scales
* [ ] subontology generation based on the ratio of included axioms
